        <p>My name is Mattis. I began facilitating <a href="http://www.lightly.io">workshops in meditation and mindfulness</a> 11 years ago.</p>
        <p>That path led me to study deeper spiritual methods. With them, we can explore how to live in peace while Creating with higher forces. </p>
        <p>As a fellow practitioner on the path, I can provide clarity and structure to our learning. The *answers* will come from other sources.</p>
